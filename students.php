	<h2>Jayda Medina</h2>
	<h3>Computer Science major</h3>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>I was born in Manhattan, NY to an immigrant mother from Guyana and a Puerto Rican father. I grew up in Brooklyn, NY. I went to Hebrew Educational Society for pre-kindergarten. Afterwards, I went down the street to P.S.115 for kindergarten - fifth grade. For Junior High I went to I.S.211. In eighth grade I got into Academy for Young Writers, and that’s where I spent the rest of grade school. Recently I moved from Brooklyn, NY to Long Island, but most of my family still lives in Brooklyn. I’ve visited my mother’s home country of Guyana, and the culture is a lot different than it is in America. However, I have never visited Puerto Ricao. I am now a student at the University of Rochester.</p>
	<h3>Academics</h3>
	<p>During my first semester at the University of Rochester, I took Beginning American Sign Language, CSC170, CSC161, and MTH140. That semester I made Dean’s List and was invited to join the National Society of Collegiate Scholars. The following semester I took CSC171, MTH150, Beginning American Sign Language II, and WRT105 RAGE!. My humanities cluster is American Sign Language and I’m still deciding my Social Science cluster. I am currently deciding between Gender and Women’s studies and Anthropology. This semester I’m taking Intro to Medical Anthropology, which can be used towards either cluster. I’m doing a human and computer interactions track, with the goal of getting a Bachelor of Arts for Computer Science.</p>
	<h3>Personal Anecdotes</h3>
	<p>When I’m not in class, or studying, I’m doing one of my many extra curriculars. Last semester, some friends and I started Students for Chronic Illness Visibility. This is our first semester as a SA recognized club. We are devoted to spreading awareness about chronic illnesses and promoting accessibility and proper accommodations on campus. One of our goals this year is to create a lending library, where people can borrow braces, mobility aids, and anything else that might getting around campus with a chronic illness easier. We are also working towards getting students with disabilities priority in U of R’s housing lottery. Outside of SCIV, I’m also a member of Strong Jugglers and TOOP. Strong Jugglers is a circus arts club where we perform juggling, flow arts, balancing acts, and other circus arts. TOOP is a student run theatre company.</p>

	<h2>Kevin Kao</h2>
	<h3>Computer Science major</h3>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Hello there! My name is Kevin Kao. I was born in New York but went to Taiwan for primary and secondary educations! I am currently a student (sophomore) doubling major in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Rochester. I have strong interest in the field of science, and I have taken many courses related to my major last year. For example, I took CSC (170, 171, 172) and MTH (150, 165, 171, 172). In addition to that, I am now taking CSC (173, 174, 214) and MTH (173, 190, 201) to better prepare me for my career. Here I would like to share what triggers me to become a copmuter scientist and why I love technology so much!</p>
	<h3>Academics</h3>
	<p>As the pioneer institution in advanced research and innovation, Hajim School of Engineering will be the perfect place for my exploratory journey to become a great engineer. I would expose myself to the many different fields of engineering by taking advantage of the wide selection of courses and learning from the world-class faculty at the School of Engineering. While the exceptional academic program will prepare me with a solid knowledge foundation, the abundant research and internship opportunities would allow me to apply and experiment the knowledge alongside with prominent professors and industry leaders. As the founder of Math Team and member of Engineering Club at my high school, I created a supportive learning environment to tackle interesting math problems and build robots outside of the classroom with peers who shared the same passion. I enjoy putting ideas into actions and learning through peer-led collaboration.</p>
	<h3>Personal Anecdotes</h3>
	<p>When I was four years old, I had severe pneumonia, for which I stayed in the ICU for two weeks. When I was seven, I had an asthma attack on the running track during elementary school. I was taken to the ER to be treated with a nebulizer. In both cases, I would not have survived without the care of doctors, nurses, parents, and more importantly, the advanced medical technology that made treatment possible. Since then, I was determined to improve human life with technology. Technology has saved my life twice.</p>

	<h2>Jonathan Roman</h2>
	<img src="images/jon.jpg" alt="Jon">
	<h3>Computer Science major</h3>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>My name is Jonathan Roman. I'm from Tenafly, NJ and was born September 6th, 1997. I currently attend the University of Rochester with a major in Computer Science. MY hobbies include playing video games and basketball, both of which I participate in groups around campus for. Throughout high school I would work as a part-time tennis coach, though mostly had very light hours (about 4-5 hours a week). The hours were fairly flexible and I could pick up lessons whenever my local tennis club was teaching them, allowing me to change my schedule regularly as needed. At the time I was on the varsity tennis team so the only prerequisite I needed was to be able to play and have the patience to deal with children aged anywhere from 6-14. This was my first job I received on my own as well, which was different but educational for a 15-year-old me. </p>
	<h3>Academics</h3>
	<p>As far as my academic career used to be, I was very into biology in high school. I would attend science competitions and fairs to present research I had begun through a special science research program in my school (which I credit my acceptance to the University of Rochester to). Since I was still a teenager, I had not really explored many fields up to this point and although the idea of biology excited me, I do not believe I was truly passionate about it. I had always been into video games and technology since I was old enough to operate a screen, so it seemed logical that I would like computer science, but my school did not offer anything in the field, so I entered the University of Rochester with a major in biology. Once I arrived at college, I continued with my track for a year or two before I began taking classes in computer science and instantly fell in love with it. I did not realize how much I would truly enjoy the field but I am extremely happy I will end up being able to complete my major within the 4 years even with some extra classes from other fields under my belt.</p>
	<h3>Personal Anecdotes</h3>
	<p>My hobbies slightly changed when I arrived to college. I, for the most part, stopped playing tennis and picked up basketball as my favorite sport. Since then I've tried to play nearly every day, and I'm currently the captain of the men's club basketball team here at the University of Rochester. It's been a very different experience to transition from an individually dependent sport such as tennis to a fully organized team sport like basketball. It's been a learning experience and really has helped me grow as a person in regards to my ability to work well with other people / teammates. My interest in gaming remains mostly unchanged, and I'm still keeping up to date with all the changing information in that industry.</p>

	<h2>Lihui Guo</h2>
	<img src="images/lihui.png" alt="Lihui">
	<h3>Business major</h3>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>I grew up in Brooklyn, New York in a predominantly Asian-American and Italian-American neighborhood. My parents had just moved from Japan/China to be with other family in New York City. I spent a lot of time with relatives as a child, particularly with my older cousins and grandparents. Our neighborhood had everything we needed – everything was within walking distance, and it was really nice to have family so close. My family was and still is super important to me. They’re always my biggest supporters and I really appreciate how my parents aren’t stereotypical “Asian tiger parents”.</p>
	<h3>Academics</h3>
	<p>Taking Orgo in high school convinced me I wanted to work with Chemistry for the rest of my life, so I applied to way too many colleges as a Chemical Engineering major. Fast forward eight months, and I wound up at the University of Rochester. I took my introductory engineering courses and realized I did not want to be in a lab for the rest of my life. I did take a super interesting Economics course, and changed my major to Business by the end of my freshman year. It was one of the better decisions I’ve made, but I still missed using the more computational part of my brain, so I decided to give Computer Science another shot (I had taken a few classes in high school), and turned that into a minor.</p>
	<h3>Personal Anecdotes</h3>
	<p>When I started elementary school, I didn’t speak much English, so I had to take ESL classes. I picked it up quickly, and started to love reading, which probably helped. I ended up testing into a magnet middle school for music, so I spent three years pretending I knew how to play the cello. The middle school had an advanced curriculum, which prepared me well for the SHSAT, a standardized exam New Yorkers take to gain admission into selective high schools. I scored pretty high, and went to the “#1 public high school in NYC”. It was super competitive, but they offered a wide variety of courses, like Organic Chemistry.</p>
