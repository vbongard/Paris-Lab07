## Ontlology
There are two webpages. One homepage (organized in a Z pattern) and one page with student information (organized in an F pattern).

## Taxonomy
The homepage has a brief introduction to the students and a photo. It also has a list of the names of the students and their majors. The student information page lists the students. Under each student's name is the identifier that ties them together (or makes them the odd one out). This means that three are Computer Science majors but one is a Business Major. For each student, their information is included in their bio.

## Choreography
The homepage has a brief introduction to the students, a photo, and a way to move to the student information page. The students on the student information page are organized randomly with the "student left out" appearing last. Each student's information is listed chronologically (with the exception of the intro section, which comes first). The student information page is orgnanized in an F pattern.
