## Ontlology
* Domain: odd student out
* Classes: students
* Relationships: majors
Each class (student) has a name, major, introduction, academics, and personal anecdotes. One student is the "odd student out." The ontology is focusing on three students who have the same major and one student who has a different major, and thus is the odd student out.

## Taxonomy
The homepage has a brief introduction to the students and a photo. It also has a list of the names of the students and their majors. The student information page lists the students. Under each student's name is the identifier that ties them together (or makes them the odd one out). For each student, their information is included in their bio.
Each student has an Introduction, Academics, Personal Anecdotes, Name, and Major. The introduction provides background on each student which provides a good base for understanding each student and what they are like. The academics section shows each of their academic interests and pursuits, which is important because one student is different in this regard. The personal anecdotes provides more personal information and allows each student to have some of their own flaire.

## Choreography
The homepage has a brief introduction to the students, a photo, and a way to move to the student information page. The students on the student information page are organized randomly with the "student left out" appearing last. Each student's information is listed chronologically (with the exception of the intro section, which comes first). The student information page is orgnanized in an F pattern.
