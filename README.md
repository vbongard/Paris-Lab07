## Ontlology
* Domain: odd student out
* Classes: students
* Relationships: majors
Each class (student) has a name, major, introduction, academics, and personal anecdotes. One student is the "odd student out." The ontology is focusing on three students who have the same major and one student who has a different major, and thus is the odd student out.

## Taxonomy
The homepage has a brief introduction to the students and a photo. It also has a list of the names of the students and their majors. The student information page lists the students. Under each student's name is the identifier that ties them together (or makes them the odd one out). For each student, their information is included in their bio.
Each student has an Introduction, Academics, Personal Anecdotes, Name, and Major. The introduction provides background on each student which provides a good base for understanding each student and what they are like. The academics section shows each of their academic interests and pursuits, which is important because one student is different in this regard. The personal anecdotes provides more personal information and allows each student to have some of their own flaire.

## Choreography
The homepage has a brief introduction to the students, a photo, and a way to move to the student information page. The students on the student information page are organized randomly with the "student left out" appearing last. Each student's information is listed chronologically (with the exception of the intro section, which comes first). The student information page is orgnanized in an F pattern.
### Z-Pattern:
* Primary optical area: written overview of the website's purpose
* Strong follow area: photo of University of Rochester logo
  * image placeholder between this and the next
* Weak follow area: list of students and majors
* Terminal area: click here to learn about the students
### F-Pattern:
* Left to right: information about students is left to right below the photo and student name/major with the photo on the left.
* Photos break up monotony and draw the viewer's eye across the screen
* Text is short because users won't read most of it
* Major and student name follows the photo to accompany the face with a name. The introduction is first in each bio since it provides the most basic and important information.

## Design Choices (Written by Designer - Jonathan Roman)

* Fonts chosen to represent a "Tech" look for the computer science majors and a more formal business-like look for the student with the business major.

* Chose light purple background to provide a nice-looking background while not hindering the legibility of the text. It's a light enough background to provide similar visibility to white but provides an other-than-plain look.

* Attempted to use image sizes that fit the resolution of the photos, however some of the photos are very poor quality. Although this is the case, I feel that shrinking the photos more would harm the appearance of the layouts and other student profiles.
